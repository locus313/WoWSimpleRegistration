    <p>1. First of all, you must create an account. The account is used to log into both the game and our website. Click
        here to open the registration page.</p>
    <p>2. Install World of Warcraft. You can download it from here: <a href="https://mega.nz/file/lJwE3C6T#foGVjhD_3jt5PEG2r6XQA2BizAfF4j-8BaN2-dpEevI" target="_blank" style="color:red">Windows</a> <!-- or Mac. Make sure to upgrade to
        our current supported patch, which is 3.3.5 (build 12340). Patch mirrors can be found here. --> </p>
    <p>3. Open up the "World of Warcraft" directory. The default directory is "C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft". When
        you've found it, open up the directory called "data", then go into the directory called either enUS or enGB,
        depending on your client language.</p>
    <p>5. Erase all text and change it to:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;color:darkred">set
        realmlist <?php echo get_config('realmlist'); ?></p>
    <p>You may now start playing! If you need any help, do not hesitate to create a support ticket.</p>
